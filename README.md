# Bacterial-Biodiversity

An exploratory analysis on the biodiversity of bacterial contained in the human navel in an attempt to find a bacteria capable of creating a flavor similar to beef.  The analysis is performed and the results are displayed in charts powered by the JavaScript library Plotly.

## Background

Many bacterial species are not well studied and there are even more that are completely unknown to science.  The purpose of this project is to discover and document some more of these bacteria.  We are particularly interested in bacterial species that can synthesize proteins that taste similar to beef.  We have partnered with a food startup called Improbable Beef to research candidate bacterial species.  

### Background

Our research has shown us that there are already labs around the country that have been successful manufacturing meats from algae, fungi and microorganisms found in plant roots.  We have a hypothesis that we can find a microorganism that can supply the next best taste from bacteria found on the human body.  The human body is the source of thousands of types of bacteria and different parts harbor different species.  Bacteria between individuals can vary even in the same location.  We believe that the ideal bacterial species can be found in the belly button.

### Methodology

We have sampled the navels of people across the country in order to identify bacteria species that colonize the belly buttons of human beings.  Each personâ€™s identity is anonymous and the samples can instead be accessed through an ID number.  The idea is to build a dashboard of the information that has been gleaned from the study and present it so that it can be accessed by both researchers for further research as well as participants of the study for their own interest.

## Outcomes

The outcomes of the study have been published at a website viewable here: https://forthegold.github.io/Bacterial-Biodiversity/ .

The general layout of the website can be seen in the following image.

The menu on the left side of the page can be used to select the results of a given participant.  The tables and graphs will update dynamically according to the participant that has been selected in the dropdown menu.  The drop down menu, the table of information and two of the graphs can be viewed in the following image.

The final image displays the third and final graph.  All of the graphs are created dynamically from the data.
